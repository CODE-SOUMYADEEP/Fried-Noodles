Instructions:-

1.Boil the noodles with salt and a teaspoon of oil till al dente. My rule of thumb is to boil the noodles for 30 seconds less than the package instructions.

2.Immediately drain them in a colander and wash them thoroughly with cold water.

3.Once they are completely drained, spread them out in an even layer on a sheet or parchment paper and leave them out to dry for 30 minutes.

4.After 30 minutes, sprinkle the noodles with cornflour and toss them well.

5.Heat oil in a cast iron skillet or frying pan till it starts shimmering (350F/ 180C). You can drop a small piece of noodle in the oil to check if it's hot enough. If there is no movement in the oil when you drop the noodle, it's not hot enough.

6.Keep the heat to medium high, and add a handful of noodles to the oil, spreading them out. Deep fry them for 2-3 minutes till they are a deep golden brown. Do this in batches so that the temperature of the oil does not drop down significantly once you add the noodles.

7.Drain them out on some tissue paper and let them cool completely before using. You can store them in an airtight container for up to 10 days.
